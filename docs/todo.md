- process intraday data
  - get all files
    - each file is in csv format
    - Timestamp,Gmtoffset,Datetime,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
    - ensure Gmtoffset is 0, throw error if not
  - parse all files
    - put data in an array of six-tuples or hashes if not too slow
      - timestamp
      - open
      - high
      - low
      - close
      - volume
    - have the first and last timestamps handy
  - find data range
    - start - first entry of first file
    - end - last entry of last file
  - create a list of output file intervals
    - later on, we will be creating one file per interval
    - in our case, one file per month, format YYYY-MM.csv
  - for each interval
    - find input data files (their parsed data) that overlap with the interval
